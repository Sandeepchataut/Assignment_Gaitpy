# To extract gait features from time-series IMU data and visualize the insights

##What is Gaitpy?
GaitPy is a Python package that provides tools for analyzing and modeling human gait data. It reads and processes raw vertical accelerometry data and extract clinical gait characteristics. It is primarily used in biomechanics research to analyze and understand the movement patterns of human subjects during walking. The GaitPy package offers various features to analyze and process gait data, such as calculating gait events, computing gait parameters, and performing statistical analysis. It also provides functions for visualizing and plotting gait data, which can aid in understanding and interpreting the results of the analysis.
Some of the specific functionalities of GaitPy include:
*Extraction of gait events such as heel strike and toe-off
*Calculation of temporal and spatial gait parameters, such as gait speed, step length, and cadence
*Visualization of gait data using plots such as gait cycles, time series, and histograms
*Statistical analysis of gait data, including computing means, standard deviations, and confidence intervals
